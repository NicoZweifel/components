# Mintlify Components

Open-source library of UI components made with React and TailwindCSS. Checkout [Mintlify.com](https://mintlify.com/) to see the components in action.

Mintlify uses Mintlify Components in customers' docs. We encourage you to use them elsewhere on your site!

# Designed for Next.js

The project is designed for use in static side rendering where we don't have access to `document` or `window`. Thus, our webpack config has to use `mini-css-extract-plugin` instead of `style-loader`.

# Documentation

Our [wiki](https://github.com/mintlify/components/wiki) contains most of the library's documentation.

[Mintlify's documentation platform also explains how to use documentation components.](https://www.mintlify.com/components/overview)

# Long Term Vision

The first version of this library only included documentation components. In the long run, Mintlify will include layout components you could use to build an entire site.
